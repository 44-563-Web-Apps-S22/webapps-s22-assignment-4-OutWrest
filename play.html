    <h2>The Impostures of Scapin</h2>
    <h3>Act I:</h3>

    <h4>OCT.</h4> <p>At least advise me, and tell me what I ought to do in this
    wretched business.</p>

    <h4>SIL.</h4> <p>I really feel as much perplexed as you, and I myself need the
    advice of some one to guide me.</p>

    <h4>OCT.</h4> <p>I am undone by this unforeseen return.</p>

    <h4>SIL.</h4> <p>And I no less.</p>

    <h4>OCT.</h4> <p>When my father hears what has taken place, a storm of reprimands
    will burst upon me.</p>

    <h4>SIL.</h4> <p>Reprimands are not very heavy to bear; would to heaven I were
    free at that price! But I am very likely to pay dearly for all your
    wild doings, and I see a storm of blows ready to burst upon my
    shoulders.</p>

    <h4>OCT.</h4> <p>Heavens! how am I to get clear of all the difficulties that
    beset my path!</p>

    <h4>SIL.</h4> <p>You should have thought of that before entering upon it.</p>

    <h4>OCT.</h4> <p>Oh, don't come and plague me to death with your unreasonable
    lectures.</p>

    <h4>SIL.</h4> <p>You plague me much more by your foolish deeds.</p>

    <h4>OCT.</h4> <p>What am I to do? What steps must I take? To what course of
    action have recourse?</p>
